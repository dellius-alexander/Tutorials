# Automated SSH Login Using `gopass` and `sshpass`

To enable automated SSH logins using a password stored in `gopass`, you can use SSH with a password manager like `gopass` by configuring the system to retrieve the password automatically upon login. Here’s how you can set it up:

### Steps for Automated SSH Login Using `gopass`:

1. **Ensure SSH Key-Based Authentication**:
   While SSH typically relies on key-based authentication, automating password retrieval from `gopass` can work when using SSH password-based login, although using SSH keys is generally more secure.

2. **Install `sshpass`**:
   You’ll need to install a tool like `sshpass`, which automates SSH logins by supplying the password non-interactively.

   - On Ubuntu/Debian:
     ```bash
     sudo apt-get install sshpass
     ```

   - On macOS (using Homebrew):
     ```bash
     brew install sshpass
     ```

3. **Use `gopass` to Retrieve the Password**:
   You can configure a shell script or directly pass the password retrieved by `gopass` into `sshpass` when logging in via SSH.

   **Example script**:
   ```bash
   #!/bin/bash

   # Retrieve password from gopass
   PASSWORD=$(gopass show ssh/client1 --quiet)

   # Use sshpass with ssh to log in
   sshpass -p "$PASSWORD" ssh user@remote_host
   ```

4. **Automate the Login**:
   You can now automate the login using this script. When you run the script, it will retrieve the password from `gopass` and use `sshpass` to log in.

### Important Considerations:
- **Security**: Although using a password manager like `gopass` helps in securely storing passwords, it is recommended to use SSH keys for automated login as it’s more secure than passwords.
- **SSH Config File**: You can also configure your `~/.ssh/config` file for multiple SSH hosts and use a script that queries the password from `gopass` based on the host.

Example:
```bash
Host myserver
    HostName remote_host
    User myusername
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa
```

If your organization strictly requires passwords, this method with `gopass` and `sshpass` ensures that your passwords remain safely managed while automating the login process.
