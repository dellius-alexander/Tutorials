To set up proxy headers for Synology SSO Server to redirect using an app ID for a domain behind your Synology Proxy Server, you need to configure your Synology Application Portal and ensure your proxy headers are set correctly in Synology’s Reverse Proxy settings. Here's a comprehensive guide:

### Step 1: Access Synology Application Portal

1. **Log in** to your Synology NAS as an administrator.
2. Go to **Control Panel** > **Application Portal**.
3. Select **Reverse Proxy** under the **Reverse Proxy** tab.

### Step 2: Create or Edit a Reverse Proxy Rule

1. **Add a new reverse proxy rule**:
    - Click **Create** to add a new rule.
    - Fill in the details as follows:
        - **Description**: Give your proxy rule a meaningful name (e.g., "SSO App Redirect").
        - **Source**:
            - **Protocol**: Select `HTTP` or `HTTPS` depending on your configuration.
            - **Hostname**: Enter the domain name (e.g., `app.mydomain.com`).
            - **Port**: Set the port number (default is `80` for HTTP or `443` for HTTPS).
        - **Destination**:
            - **Protocol**: Choose the same protocol (`HTTP` or `HTTPS`).
            - **Hostname**: Enter the internal IP address or hostname of your SSO server.
            - **Port**: Specify the port your Synology SSO service listens on (default is typically `5001` for HTTPS).

2. **Add a custom header** to pass the app ID:
    - Click on the **Advanced Settings** button.
    - Under **Custom Header**, add a header to pass the application ID and other required values:
        - **Header Name**: `X-App-ID` (or the appropriate header used by your application/Synology SSO)
        - **Header Value**: Enter the application ID (e.g., `app-id-123`).

   You may also need to add other headers depending on the application requirements:
    - **X-Forwarded-For**: `${client_ip}`
    - **X-Real-IP**: `${client_ip}`
    - **X-Forwarded-Host**: `${host}`
    - **X-Forwarded-Proto**: `${scheme}`

3. **Save** the rule.

### Step 3: Verify the SSO Configuration

1. In your Synology SSO Server or the application settings, make sure it recognizes the custom header (`X-App-ID`) and routes requests appropriately based on its value.
2. Ensure that any necessary authentication mechanisms (e.g., JWT token, session cookies) are properly configured and forwarded by the reverse proxy.

### Step 4: Test the Configuration

1. Access the domain (e.g., `https://app.mydomain.com`) from your browser.
2. Verify that:
    - The request is forwarded correctly to the SSO server.
    - The SSO server authenticates based on the `X-App-ID` or other headers set.
    - The correct application page is displayed based on the app ID.

### Additional Tips

- **HTTPS Configuration**: If using HTTPS, ensure that the certificates for your domain are correctly installed and set up in the **Security** > **Certificate** section.
- **CORS Configuration**: If the SSO application requires cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) settings, configure these under **Reverse Proxy** > **Custom Header** by adding the appropriate `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` and other CORS-related headers.

This setup will allow your Synology SSO Server to authenticate users using the app ID and properly redirect them based on the domain managed by your Synology reverse proxy. Let me know if any further details are required!

To set up CORS headers in your Synology Reverse Proxy configuration, you should add specific headers to ensure that cross-origin requests are handled correctly. These headers control which domains can access your resources and which HTTP methods are allowed.

### Recommended CORS Headers for Synology Reverse Proxy

1. **Access-Control-Allow-Origin**:
    - Specifies which origins are allowed to access the resource.
    - **Value**: You can either set it to a specific domain (`https://app.mydomain.com`) or use a wildcard (`*`) to allow any domain (not recommended for security reasons).
    - Example:
      ```http
      Access-Control-Allow-Origin: https://app.mydomain.com
      ```

2. **Access-Control-Allow-Methods**:
    - Lists the HTTP methods that are permitted for cross-origin requests.
    - **Value**: Include the methods your application supports, such as `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`, etc.
    - Example:
      ```http
      Access-Control-Allow-Methods: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, OPTIONS
      ```

3. **Access-Control-Allow-Headers**:
    - Specifies the headers that are allowed in the request. This is important if you use custom headers like `X-App-ID`, `Authorization`, or others.
    - **Value**: Include any headers your application might need, such as:
      ```http
      Access-Control-Allow-Headers: X-App-ID, Authorization, Content-Type, Accept
      ```

4. **Access-Control-Allow-Credentials**:
    - Indicates whether the response to the request can be exposed when the credentials flag is true (e.g., cookies, authorization headers).
    - **Value**: `true` (only use this if your application supports and requires credentials).
    - Example:
      ```http
      Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true
      ```

5. **Access-Control-Max-Age**:
    - Indicates how long the results of a preflight request can be cached.
    - **Value**: Number of seconds the results can be cached (e.g., `3600` for 1 hour).
    - Example:
      ```http
      Access-Control-Max-Age: 3600
      ```

### Adding CORS Headers in Synology Reverse Proxy

1. **Go to**: **Control Panel** > **Application Portal** > **Reverse Proxy**.
2. **Select the reverse proxy rule** you configured for your application (e.g., "SSO App Redirect").
3. Click **Edit**, and then go to **Advanced Settings**.
4. In the **Custom Header** section, add the following headers:

    - **Header Name**: `Access-Control-Allow-Origin`
        - **Header Value**: `https://app.mydomain.com`
    - **Header Name**: `Access-Control-Allow-Methods`
        - **Header Value**: `GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, OPTIONS`
    - **Header Name**: `Access-Control-Allow-Headers`
        - **Header Value**: `X-App-ID, Authorization, Content-Type, Accept`
    - **Header Name**: `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials`
        - **Header Value**: `true`
    - **Header Name**: `Access-Control-Max-Age`
        - **Header Value**: `3600`

5. **Save** the configuration.

### Additional Notes

- **Origin Restrictions**: Always specify the exact origin (`https://app.mydomain.com`) instead of using `*` to improve security.
- **Credentials Support**: Only set `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials` to `true` if necessary, as it can expose cookies and authentication tokens.
- **Preflight Requests**: Ensure that your backend or SSO server can handle HTTP `OPTIONS` requests, as these are sent as part of the CORS preflight process.

Implementing these headers correctly will ensure that your application supports secure cross-origin requests when using Synology SSO behind a reverse proxy. Let me know if you need further assistance!

Once the SSO (Single Sign-On) authentication is verified, you may need to set up a redirect header to guide the user to the intended application or service behind your Synology reverse proxy. This process involves configuring a redirect that occurs after successful authentication, ensuring that the authenticated user is directed to the correct resource.

### Setting Up the Redirect Header After SSO Verification

1. **Set Up the Redirect Rule**:
    - When configuring your SSO service or application, you typically specify a redirect URL (`redirect_uri`) as part of the authentication flow. This URL should point to the application or service the user intends to access.
    - Ensure that the **redirect_uri** parameter in your SSO configuration matches the domain/subdomain managed by the Synology reverse proxy (e.g., `https://app.mydomain.com/dashboard`).

2. **Configuring the Reverse Proxy for Redirection**:
    - Go to **Control Panel** > **Application Portal** > **Reverse Proxy**.
    - Select the reverse proxy rule that handles the SSO traffic.
    - Ensure the destination and path configuration match the redirect endpoint (`/callback` or `/dashboard`) defined in your application or SSO configuration.

3. **Adding the Redirect Header** (If Needed):
    - In most SSO setups, the redirect is automatically handled by the application based on the `redirect_uri` parameter, but you may need to add a custom header in some cases if the application requires it.
    - If a redirect header is necessary, go to the **Advanced Settings** of your reverse proxy rule:
        - **Header Name**: `Location`
        - **Header Value**: The URL where you want to redirect the user upon successful SSO verification (e.g., `https://app.mydomain.com/dashboard`).

4. **Ensure Synology SSO Server Configuration Matches**:
    - In your Synology SSO Server settings (typically found in **Control Panel** or the **SSO configuration** interface), make sure the `redirect_uri` values match the applications and domains you’ve configured in the reverse proxy.
    - You may need to list all acceptable redirect URIs if multiple applications or services are behind the proxy.

5. **Example Redirect Flow**:
    - A user accesses `https://app.mydomain.com`.
    - The request is routed to the Synology SSO server for authentication.
    - Once verified, the SSO server responds with a redirect to `https://app.mydomain.com/dashboard` based on the `redirect_uri`.
    - The reverse proxy rule must allow and support this redirection.

### Additional Considerations

- **Dynamic Redirects**: If your application requires dynamic redirects (e.g., based on user roles), ensure the application properly sets the `Location` header or generates the redirect URL within the application logic itself.
- **Security**: Avoid using open redirect patterns where the `redirect_uri` can be manipulated by the client. Always validate redirect URLs on the server-side to ensure they match the expected domains or paths.
- **Session Management**: Make sure that session tokens or cookies are forwarded correctly through the reverse proxy and included in the redirect response if needed. This often involves configuring cookies as `SameSite=None` and `Secure` if using HTTPS.

By setting up the redirect configuration and ensuring headers align with the Synology SSO settings, you can seamlessly redirect users after authentication verification. Let me know if any further customization or details are required!

The `Request Header Or Cookie Too Large` error typically occurs when the headers or cookies being sent to the server exceed the allowed size limits. This can happen if:

- The cookies stored for your domain have accumulated and become too large.
- Custom headers (e.g., for authentication) are exceeding the size limit.
- There's a misconfiguration in the server's size limits for headers or cookies.

### Steps to Resolve the Error

#### 1. **Clear Browser Cookies**

The most common cause is an oversized cookie. Clear the cookies for the specific domain causing the issue:

- **In Chrome**:
    - Go to the site causing the issue.
    - Click the lock icon in the address bar > **Cookies**.
    - Remove cookies related to the domain (`Clear cookies and site data`).

- **In Firefox**:
    - Go to **Preferences** > **Privacy & Security** > **Cookies and Site Data**.
    - Click **Manage Data**, find the domain, and remove its cookies.

After clearing the cookies, try accessing the site again.

#### 2. **Reduce Cookie Size Programmatically**

If your application manages authentication via cookies (e.g., session cookies, JWTs), consider reducing their size:
- Minimize the amount of data stored in cookies. Avoid storing large payloads in JWTs.
- Use session tokens rather than embedding too much information directly in the cookie.

#### 3. **Adjust the Header or Cookie Size Limit on Your Synology Proxy Server**

If reducing cookie size isn’t feasible, you may need to increase the header and cookie size limits on your Synology NAS to allow larger values:

1. **Access Synology's Nginx Configuration Files**:
    - Synology NAS uses Nginx for reverse proxy, but the configuration files are not directly accessible via the DSM interface.
    - You’ll need to SSH into your Synology NAS as an admin.

2. **Edit the Nginx Configuration**:
    - Locate and edit the `nginx.conf` file:
      ```bash
      sudo vi /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
      ```
    - Alternatively, check in `/etc/nginx/conf.d/` for specific reverse proxy configuration files.

3. **Increase the Limits**:
    - Add or adjust the following directives under the appropriate `http { }` or `server { }` block:
      ```nginx
      large_client_header_buffers 8 16k;
      proxy_buffer_size 16k;
      ```
    - The `large_client_header_buffers` directive increases the maximum size for request headers.
    - Adjust these values if necessary, depending on the size of your headers.

4. **Reload Nginx**:
    - Save your changes and reload Nginx:
      ```bash
      sudo synoservicecfg --restart nginx
      ```

#### 4. **Verify Headers and Cookies**

- Ensure your application is not sending excessive or redundant headers.
- Debug by using browser developer tools or a tool like `curl` to inspect the headers and cookies being sent.

### Summary
- **Clear browser cookies** to resolve temporary issues.
- **Optimize your cookies** and headers if the size is too large.
- **Adjust the Nginx configuration** on your Synology NAS to increase the allowed size if necessary.

To modify the Nginx proxy settings on your Synology NAS to handle SSO server authentication before redirecting to the target application, you need to ensure that the Nginx configuration is set up to handle the SSO flow correctly, including passing the necessary headers and handling redirects properly. Below are steps and adjustments to optimize the configuration based on your settings.

### Updated Configuration

```nginx
server {
    listen 443 ssl;
    listen [::]:443 ssl;

    include conf.d/.resolve.conf*;
    set $backend "https://sso.dalexander1618.synology.me:443";

    server_name router.dalexander1618.synology.me;

    # Ensure that the request is only accepted for the specific host
    if ($host !~ "(^router.dalexander1618.synology.me$)") {
        return 404;
    }

    include /usr/syno/etc/www/certificate/ReverseProxy_950a5370-34a2-41af-a7e9-c9be80a0558f/cert.conf*;
    include /usr/syno/etc/security-profile/tls-profile/config/ReverseProxy_950a5370-34a2-41af-a7e9-c9be80a0558f.conf*;

    proxy_ssl_protocols TLSv1 TLSv1.1 TLSv1.2 TLSv1.3;
    include conf.d/.acl.246131b4-7c04-43df-9d3d-d3462314928b.conf*;

    location / {
        proxy_connect_timeout 60;
        proxy_read_timeout 60;
        proxy_send_timeout 60;
        proxy_intercept_errors off;

        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection "upgrade";
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
        proxy_set_header X-App-ID ead6011e2c1394755c2452699c85281f;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Port 443;

        # Added settings for SSO handling
        proxy_set_header Cookie $http_cookie;
        proxy_set_header Authorization $http_authorization;
        proxy_pass_request_headers on;

        # Forward to the SSO backend
        proxy_pass $backend;

        # Handle the redirect to target application after SSO authentication
        proxy_redirect https://sso.dalexander1618.synology.me/ https://router.dalexander1618.synology.me/;
    }

    error_page 403 404 500 502 503 504 /dsm_error_page;

    location /dsm_error_page {
        internal;
        root /usr/syno/share/nginx;
        rewrite (.*) /error.html break;
        allow all;
    }
}
```

### Explanation of Changes

1. **Cookie and Authorization Headers**:
    - Added `proxy_set_header Cookie $http_cookie;` and `proxy_set_header Authorization $http_authorization;` to forward cookies and authorization tokens from the client to the SSO server. This is essential for maintaining the authentication session and passing credentials if needed.

2. **SSO Redirect Handling**:
    - Added `proxy_redirect https://sso.dalexander1618.synology.me/ https://router.dalexander1618.synology.me/;` to handle the redirection after successful SSO authentication.
    - This ensures that after the SSO server verifies the user, they are redirected back to the target application (`https://router.dalexander1618.synology.me`).

3. **Set X-App-ID**:
    - The `X-App-ID` header remains in place to identify the application and match it with the backend SSO service configuration.

4. **Forward Host and Port Properly**:
    - The headers `X-Forwarded-Host` and `X-Forwarded-Port` are set correctly to reflect the external and internal proxy settings, which are essential for correct routing and redirection.

### Additional Notes

1. **Ensure the Backend Accepts the Headers**:
    - Make sure the Synology SSO server is configured to accept the necessary headers (`Cookie`, `Authorization`, and any custom headers like `X-App-ID`).

2. **Nginx Restart**:
    - After modifying the configuration file, restart Nginx to apply the changes:
      ```bash
      sudo synoservicecfg --restart nginx
      ```

3. **Testing**:
    - Access `https://router.dalexander1618.synology.me` and ensure that the SSO flow redirects you properly after successful authentication.

4. **TLS/SSL Considerations**:
    - Ensure your certificates are valid and correctly set up for both the SSO (`sso.dalexander1618.synology.me`) and the router (`router.dalexander1618.synology.me`) domains.

This configuration should correctly set up the Nginx proxy server on Synology NAS to handle SSO server authentication and redirect users properly based on their authentication status. Let me know if further details or adjustments are needed!

To perform an HTTP redirect, you typically use the **`Location`** header in the response from the server. This header indicates the URL to which the client should be redirected. Here's how it works in different contexts:

### Using the `Location` Header for Redirects

1. **Basic Redirect**:
    - When you want to redirect a client to a new URL, you set the `Location` header in the HTTP response along with an appropriate HTTP status code (usually `301`, `302`, `303`, or `307`).

   **Example**:
   ```http
   HTTP/1.1 302 Found
   Location: https://example.com/new-url
   ```

    - **Status Codes**:
        - **`301 Moved Permanently`**: The resource has been moved permanently to a new URL. This is a permanent redirect.
        - **`302 Found`**: The resource is temporarily located at a different URL. This is a temporary redirect.
        - **`303 See Other`**: Used for POST requests. It indicates that the client should use a GET request to fetch the resource from the new URL.
        - **`307 Temporary Redirect`**: Similar to `302`, but it preserves the HTTP method used in the original request.

2. **Nginx Configuration for Redirects**:
    - In an Nginx configuration (like your Synology NAS setup), you can also use the `rewrite` directive to achieve a redirect.
    - For example, if you want to redirect all requests from `/old-path` to `/new-path`, you can do this:
   ```nginx
   location /old-path {
       return 301 https://example.com/new-path;
   }
   ```

3. **Proxy Redirect in Nginx**:
    - If you're proxying requests to another server, you might want to modify the `Location` header in the response from the proxied server. This is done with the `proxy_redirect` directive:
   ```nginx
   location / {
       proxy_pass https://backend-server;
       proxy_redirect https://backend-server/ https://router.dalexander1618.synology.me/;
   }
   ```

### Example Scenario for SSO

In the context of your SSO server, after a successful authentication, you might want to redirect users to a specific application page. The SSO server would send a response like this:

```http
HTTP/1.1 302 Found
Location: https://app.mydomain.com/dashboard
```

### Important Considerations

- **Client-Side Handling**: The client (e.g., a web browser) automatically follows the redirect specified in the `Location` header.
- **Security**: Ensure that the URLs provided in the `Location` header are safe and validated to prevent open redirect vulnerabilities.
- **CORS**: If the redirect involves cross-origin requests, make sure to handle CORS headers appropriately to avoid issues with browser security policies.

By using the `Location` header correctly along with appropriate status codes, you can effectively manage HTTP redirects in your application. Let me know if you need further clarification on any of these points!
