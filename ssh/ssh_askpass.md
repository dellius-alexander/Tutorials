# SSH-ASKPASS Installation and Usages

---

## Install `ssh_askpass` on macOS

To install `ssh_askpass` on macOS, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Install XQuartz (Dependency for `ssh_askpass`)

`ssh_askpass` requires XQuartz, which provides the X11 display server for macOS, used by graphical applications like `ssh_askpass`.

1. **Download and install XQuartz** from the official website:
   
   [XQuartz Download](https://www.xquartz.org/)

2. **Install XQuartz** by running the `.dmg` installer and following the prompts.

3. **Restart your computer** after installation to ensure that XQuartz is fully set up.

### Step 2: Install `ssh_askpass` using Homebrew

Once XQuartz is installed, you can install `ssh_askpass` using **Homebrew** (a package manager for macOS).

1. **Install Homebrew** if you haven't already:
   
   Open Terminal and run:
   
   ```bash
   /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
   ```

2. **Install `ssh-askpass`** via Homebrew:

   Run the following command in your Terminal:

   ```bash
   brew install ssh-askpass
   ```

3. **Link `ssh-askpass`** to make sure it’s available for SSH to use:

   ```bash
   ln -sf /usr/local/bin/ssh-askpass /usr/local/bin/ssh-askpass
   ```

### Step 3: Set `SSH_ASKPASS` Environment Variable

To ensure that `ssh-askpass` is used when SSH requests a password or passphrase, you need to set the `SSH_ASKPASS` environment variable.

1. Open your shell configuration file (e.g., `.bash_profile`, `.zshrc`, or `.bashrc`) in your preferred text editor.

   For example, if you're using Zsh (default for macOS Catalina and later):
   
   ```bash
   nano ~/.zshrc
   ```

2. Add the following line to set the `SSH_ASKPASS` environment variable:

   ```bash
   export SSH_ASKPASS="/usr/local/bin/ssh-askpass"
   ```

3. Save and close the file, then reload your shell configuration:

   ```bash
   source ~/.zshrc
   ```

### Step 4: Test `ssh_askpass`

Now, test the installation by initiating an SSH connection that requires a password:

```bash
ssh user@remote-server
```

You should see a graphical password prompt appear, handled by `ssh_askpass`.

## Steps to set up SSH key-based authentication

`ssh_askpass` is designed to prompt the user for their SSH passphrase or password via a graphical interface when using SSH commands. It doesn't directly store passwords for specific domains or hosts. However, you can streamline your SSH authentication using key-based authentication or by securely storing passwords using a password manager. Here's a breakdown of how to manage domain-specific SSH passwords:

### Option 1: Use SSH Key-Based Authentication (Recommended)

If you want to avoid entering passwords for specific domain names, **SSH key-based authentication** is the most secure and efficient approach.

#### Steps to set up SSH key-based authentication:

1. **Generate an SSH key pair (if you don’t have one already):**
   
   Open Terminal and run:
   
   ```bash
   ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096
   ```

   This will generate a key pair (`id_rsa` and `id_rsa.pub`) in `~/.ssh/`. You can leave the passphrase blank to avoid needing `ssh_askpass`.

2. **Copy the public key to the remote server:**

   Use the following command to copy the SSH public key to the remote server:

   ```bash
   ssh-copy-id user@remote-server
   ```

   Replace `user` and `remote-server` with your actual credentials.

3. **Log in without a password:**

   After copying the key, you should be able to log in to the remote server without a password:

   ```bash
   ssh user@remote-server
   ```

4. **Automate for multiple domains:**

   You can configure SSH to automatically use specific keys for different domains by editing the `~/.ssh/config` file. Here's an example configuration:

   ```bash
   Host example.com
       HostName example.com
       User your-username
       IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa

   Host anotherdomain.com
       HostName anotherdomain.com
       User your-username
       IdentityFile ~/.ssh/another_key_rsa
   ```

   This setup allows you to manage different SSH keys for different domains and eliminate the need for passwords.

### Option 2: Use a Password Manager with `ssh_askpass`

If you prefer to stick with password-based authentication but want to manage domain-specific passwords efficiently, a **password manager** or **SSH agent** is the way to go.

1. **Use the `sshpass` command-line tool (optional)**:
   `sshpass` allows you to automate SSH password entry without needing `ssh_askpass`. Install `sshpass` using Homebrew:

   ```bash
   brew install sshpass
   ```

   Then, you can store and use the password for a specific domain like this:

   ```bash
   sshpass -p $(echo $PASSPHRASE | base64 -d) ssh user@remote-server
   ```

2. **Integrate with a password manager**:
   
   Consider using a password manager (like **1Password**, **Bitwarden**, or **LastPass**) to securely store passwords. Many password managers offer command-line tools that can be integrated with SSH for automated password retrieval when prompted.

   For example, with **1Password**:

   - Install the **1Password CLI tool** (`op`).
   - Retrieve the password stored in your 1Password vault and use it with SSH.

   ```bash
   PASSWORD=$(op item get "SSH Password" --fields label=password)
   sshpass -p "$PASSWORD" ssh user@remote-server
   ```

   This setup securely retrieves your password and passes it to `sshpass` or `ssh_askpass` for SSH login.

### Option 3: Use `ssh-agent` to Cache Passphrases (For SSH Key Passphrases)

If you're using SSH keys but have passphrases set on them, you can use `ssh-agent` to cache your passphrases so you don't have to enter them each time.

1. **Start the `ssh-agent`:**

   ```bash
   eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
   ```

2. **Add your SSH key to the agent:**

   ```bash
   ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa
   ```

   You'll be prompted for your passphrase once. After that, the agent will remember it.

3. **Automate `ssh-agent` on login**:

   You can add the above commands to your `~/.bash_profile`, `~/.zshrc`, or equivalent shell startup file so that `ssh-agent` starts and caches your key automatically when you log in to your computer.

By using key-based authentication, password managers, or `ssh-agent`, you can avoid repeatedly entering passwords while maintaining security when connecting to remote servers.

## Running a Secondary Command on Remote Docker Host

To run a secondary command like `docker ps` that requires SSH access to a remote server and automatically insert a password, you can use the `sshpass` tool. This tool allows you to pass a password non-interactively for SSH commands. Here's how you can do it:


### Option 1: Run SSH with Password Automatically

You can run a command like `docker ps` on a remote Docker host using `sshpass` to provide the SSH password. Here’s an example command to run `docker ps` remotely:

```bash
sshpass -p 'your_password' ssh -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no user@remote-server docker ps
```

- Replace `your_password` with the actual password.
- Replace `user` with your SSH username.
- Replace `remote-server` with the remote Docker host address (e.g., `docker.example.com`).
  
The `-o StrictHostKeyChecking=no` option prevents SSH from prompting for confirmation to add the host to the list of known hosts.

### Option 2: Use with Docker Context

If you're using Docker contexts for remote management and want to run Docker commands like `docker ps` with password automation, you can also set it up with `sshpass` and Docker’s SSH context:

```bash
sshpass -p 'your_password' docker --context my-remote-context ps
```

### Example Use Case with Docker:

```bash
sshpass -p 'your_password' ssh -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no user@remote-server docker ps
```

This command will automatically insert the password and execute the `docker ps` command on the remote server without requiring user interaction.

### Security Warning

Using `sshpass` with a plaintext password in the command line is insecure because your password can be visible in the process list and shell history. For a more secure approach, consider:

- Using SSH key-based authentication.
- Storing passwords in environment variables or using a password manager tool.

If you still want to proceed with `sshpass`, consider wrapping the password in a script that is secured from exposure.
