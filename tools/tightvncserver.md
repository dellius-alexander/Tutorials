So, here's a command line example that uses all of the available options for `tightvncserver`:

```bash
tightvncserver \
-geometry 1920x1080 \
-depth 24 \
-name membe-desktop \
-alwaysshared -noxstartup \
-SecurityTypes VncAuth,TLSVnc \
-rfbport 5901 \
-localhost yes \
-nolisten tcp \
-extension RANDR \
-AcceptCutText -AcceptPointerEvents -AcceptKeyEvents -Noxdamage -NoTildeSilent 
```

---

Here's what each option does:

-`geometry 1280x720`: sets the screen resolution to 1280x720 pixels.

-`depth 24`: sets the color depth to 24 bits per pixel.

-`name MyVNCServer`: sets the name of the VNC server to "MyVNCServer".

-`alwaysshared`: allows multiple clients to connect to the VNC server simultaneously.

-`noxstartup`: disables automatic startup of a default window manager.

-`SecurityTypes VncAuth,TLSVnc`: enables VNC authentication and TLS encryption for the VNC connection.

-`rfbport 5901`: sets the VNC server port number to 5901.

-`localhost yes`: allows connections only from the local machine.

-`nolisten tcp`: disables listening for incoming TCP connections.

-`extension RANDR`: enables the RANDR extension, which allows resizing the VNC viewer window without disconnecting.
Note that not all options may be necessary or appropriate for your specific use case, so you should carefully review the available options and adjust them as needed.

-`AcceptCutText`: allows the VNC client to exchange clipboard data with the VNC server.

-`AcceptPointerEvents`: allows the VNC client to send mouse events to the VNC server.

-`AcceptKeyEvents`: allows the VNC client to send keyboard events to the VNC server.

-`Noxdamage`: disables screen damage detection.

-`NoTildeSilent`: disables the "~" key as a special key to hide/show the VNC viewer toolbar.
